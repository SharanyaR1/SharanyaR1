# Hey there 👋

I'm Sharanya, a Computer Science Engineering student who learned more from Stack Overflow than college lectures. A developer who builds real, useful things. If it solves a problem (even the tiniest ones), I'm interested! The best part of development? When someone uses what I built and says *This actually helps!* - that moment is what keeps me coding. When not debugging, I'm painting murals across Bangalore with [Creatibeeti](https://www.instagram.com/creatibeeti/), adding color to our city's walls. Besides art, I also enjoy cooking and watching sitcoms.

## Projects That Actually Taught Me Stuff
[Code Canvas](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/...) - Digital sticky notes for your code - because learning shouldn't mean drowning in comments.
[Royal Public School](https://www.royalpublicschool.in/) - A functional website that serves real users.
